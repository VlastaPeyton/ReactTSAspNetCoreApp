PWA = Progressive Web App

PWA web app osobine:
      1) Installable - can be added to desktop
      1) No app store required - can install it from browser
      2) Offline-capable - via caching works without internet collection but cannot make api request
      3) Fast - loads fast even on slow network
      4) Responsive - works on mobile, tablet and desktop without need for making separate React Native app za mobile
                      PWA za mobile koristim ako app ne koristi GPS, imenik, camera, vec samo iskljucivo kao web app sluzi i na telefonu (eCommerce, portal itd.)
      5) Secure - over HTTPS radi
      6) Push notifications

Technologies behind PWA:
      1) Service workers - background script that handles caching, offline mode, push notifications
      2) Web App Manifest - JSON file defining app name, icon, theme, install behavior
      3) HTTPS - security
